## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added single quotes around 'SQL' in the description;

* In the examples with '\dontrun{}', I have added comments
explaining why these code sections are not run.

Additionally, I can confirm that there are no references which describe
the methods in this package.

Thank you for handling this submission!
